useReducer is similar to useState, But instead of providing state & setter function. 
It provides state and dispatch function

The useReducer Hook accepts two arguments
- Reducer function
- Initial state
and returns: Current state and Dispatch method

Its first argument the reducer function specifies how the state gets updated.
