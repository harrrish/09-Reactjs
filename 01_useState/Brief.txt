useState Hook: Overview & Applications
The useState hook is a fundamental React hook used to manage and update state in functional components. It allows you to declare a state variable and a function that updates that state.

Use useState for storing and updating primitive values like strings, numbers, booleans, or more complex types like objects and arrays.
Example: Storing user input, toggling a visibility flag, managing count in a counter app, etc.
Form Handling:

It is commonly used to handle form inputs and validation. You can manage each input field as a separate state or as a single object.
Example: Storing form input values like name, email, etc.
Conditional Rendering:

Use useState to control what is rendered in the UI. For example, toggling between showing and hiding elements.
Example: Toggling visibility of a modal, dropdown, or sidebar.
Array/Collection Updates:

useState can be used to manage arrays or collections, where you can add, remove, or update items dynamically.
Example: Adding/removing items from a list, or filtering/searching through a dataset.
Interactive Components:

It enables interactive components like counters, timers, sliders, or toggles.
Example: Implementing a counter that increments and decrements based on user actions.
