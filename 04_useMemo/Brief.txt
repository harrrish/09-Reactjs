useMemo is a React Hook that allows you to memoize (or "remember") the result of a calculation and recompute it only when certain dependencies have changed. 
This is useful for optimizing performance, especially in cases where a component re-renders frequently and performs expensive calculations.

The React useMemo Hook returns a memoized value. (it's like caching a value so that it doesn't need to be recalculated.)

This can improve the performance of the application. There is one more hook in react to improve performance, that is useCalIback hook.

The useMemo and useCallback Hooks are similar. The main difference is:
- useMemo returns a memoized VALUE.
- useCallback returns a memoized FUNCTION.

When to Use useMemo:
    When you have a complex calculation that you don’t want to repeat on every render.
    When you are passing an object or array as a prop to child components, and the child component is doing unnecessary re-renders because the reference of the object or array is changing on every render (even though its content may not change).
