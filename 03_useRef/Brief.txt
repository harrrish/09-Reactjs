useState re-renders the component after setAction function where as useRef does not.
useRef is a react Hook that allow us to create mutable variables, which will not re-render the component.
useRef is also used for accessing DOM elements.

The useRef hook in React is used to persist values across renders without causing a re-render when the value changes. 
It is primarily used to access and interact with DOM elements directly, store mutable values, or hold references to objects across renders.

Key Characteristics of useRef:
    Does not trigger re-rendering: When you change the value of a useRef object, it doesn't trigger a re-render of the component.
    Access DOM elements: It allows you to access and manipulate DOM nodes directly (e.g., focusing an input, measuring an element).
    Store mutable values: It can hold values that persist across renders, such as a counter or a reference to an external object.
    
What is useRef Used For?

Accessing DOM elements:
  You can use useRef to directly interact with DOM elements in a way that avoids the overhead of React’s re-rendering mechanism.

Persisting values across renders:
  Unlike state (useState), updating a useRef does not cause a component to re-render. 
  This is useful for storing mutable values that don’t need to trigger a re-render.

Storing previous state:
  You can use useRef to store the previous state of a component to compare it with the current state.

Storing interval IDs, timers, etc.:
  Use it to store mutable values like interval IDs or timers that you want to persist across renders, but don't need to trigger a re-render.
 
Wrapping up with useRef Applications:
  Here’s a list of common use cases for useRef:
      Accessing DOM elements (e.g., focusing an input field).
      Storing mutable values (e.g., keeping track of values that do not require re-rendering).
      Tracking previous state values without causing unnecessary renders.
      Setting up and cleaning up timers, intervals, or subscriptions.
      Storing external references like external libraries or APIs.
