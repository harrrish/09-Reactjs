useContext is a React Hook that allows you access data from any component without explicitly passing it down through props at every level.
useContext is used to manage Global data in the React App.

Important Notes about useContext
Context updates trigger re-renders:
When the value passed to the context provider changes, all components consuming that context (via useContext) will re-render with the new value.

tsx
Copy code
const [value, setValue] = useState("initial value");

return (
  <MyContext.Provider value={value}>
    <button onClick={() => setValue("new value")}>Change Value</button>
    <ChildComponent />
  </MyContext.Provider>
);
Whenever the value changes, ChildComponent will re-render to reflect the new context value.

Re-renders occur only for components using useContext:
useContext doesn't re-render all child components under the provider, only those that are consuming the context.

Context only passes values, not functions:
You should avoid passing methods or functions to the context directly because it can cause unnecessary re-renders when the function reference changes. 
You can pass a stable value like a string, number, or object, and you can use useMemo or useCallback to optimize functions passed through context.

When to use useContext vs useReducer:
useContext is useful for global values or shared state that doesn’t change often, such as user authentication status, theming, etc. 
For more complex state management with actions and reducers, useReducer is a better option.

When to Use useContext?
Global State:
If you have a global state that many components need to access (like theme settings, language preferences, or user authentication), useContext can be very useful.

Avoiding Prop Drilling:
When you need to pass data down through many levels of nested components (known as prop drilling), useContext helps avoid the need to pass props at every intermediate level.

Theming and Localization:
Contexts are commonly used for managing things like theming (light/dark mode) or localization (language settings) across an app.

User Authentication State:
If you have user authentication or user data that needs to be accessed across multiple components, context can be a great way to share this state.
